# AI Text Scrubber

AI Text Scrubber is a web application that cleans and normalizes text using a series of automated steps powered by simple AI logic. It is designed to help you quickly sanitize text for further processing, analysis, or publishing.

## Features

- **Replace Dashes:** Converts em dash (—) and en dash (–) to standard hyphens (-).
- **Remove Non-Printable Characters:** Strips out control and other non-printable characters.
- **Replace Special Quotes:** Converts curly quotes (“ ” ‘ ’) to standard quotes (" ').
- **Normalize Whitespace:** Collapses multiple spaces and trims leading/trailing whitespace.
- **Step-by-Step Output:** Shows the result of each cleaning step for transparency and debugging.

## Usage

1. Enter or paste your text into the input box.
2. The app will automatically process the text and display the output, along with details for each cleaning step.
3. Copy the cleaned text for your needs.

## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

## Project Structure

- `src/App.tsx`: Main application component and UI.
- `src/steps/index.ts`: Contains the text cleaning steps and processing logic.
- `public/`: Static assets and HTML template.
- `build/`: Production build output.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
